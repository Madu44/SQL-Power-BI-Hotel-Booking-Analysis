# SQL-Power-BI-Hotel-Booking-Analysis


CASE STUDY:

My stakeholders have asked me to build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to answer the following questions,
1.	Is our hotel revenue growing yearly? We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.
2.	Should we increase our parking lot size? We want to understand if there is a trend in guest with cars.
3.	What trends can we see in the data? Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.

PROJECT PIPELINE:
1.	Build a Database
2.	Develop the SQL Query
3.	Connect Power BI to the Database
4.	Visualize
5.	Summarize Findings
